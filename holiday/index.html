            <h2>Did you Know?</h2>
            <blockquote> Kindness Day, observed on November 13th, originated from
                the World Kindness Movement's 1998 conference
                in Tokyo,
                Japan. The conference brought together representatives from global kindness organizations to promote the
                values of
                compassion and empathy. The World Kindness Movement, which emerged from this gathering, is dedicated to
                fostering
                kindness and encouraging individuals and communities to engage in acts of goodwill. The day aims to
                highlight the
                profound impact that simple acts of kindness can have on society and to inspire people to make a
                positive
                difference in
                their communities. By celebrating World Kindness Day, people are reminded of the power of kindness to
                enhance social
                connections and improve lives, reinforcing the idea that compassion is a fundamental part of a
                harmonious
                society.</blockquote>
