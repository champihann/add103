          <aside><p>The story of Cooper Whiteshoes begins when we stumbled upon a family giving away baby Cooper. When we first met him, the owner held two adorable puppies in her hands, asking us to choose which one we wanted. We picked the little guy with two charming white front paws—a detail that later inspired his full name, Cooper Whiteshoes. He was one of a litter of three brothers, though we’ve since lost touch with his siblings.</p>
          <br>
          <p>From the start, Cooper showed signs of being one-of-a-kind. With a mix of Havanese, Poodle, and Schnauzer, he is a bundle of intelligence, personality, and quirks that make him unforgettable. Cooper is not only incredibly smart; he’s also fiercely independent, with a quirky, spirited personality. He has a mind of his own and a knack for surprising us with his playful antics and clever tricks.</p>
          <br>          
          <p>The idea behind this website is to showcase Cooper’s adventures, life, and personality for my web development class. Through this site, I hope my classmates and other visitors get a real sense of what makes Cooper so special. He’s more than just a pet—he’s a unique character with a charm that brings a smile to anyone who meets him.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Whether he's showing off his smarts, sneaking a snack, or demanding belly rubs, Cooper is truly personality plus!</p>
