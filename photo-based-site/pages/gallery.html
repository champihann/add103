        <p>&#128062 The Gallery is where Cooper’s story comes to life, capturing his journey from a tiny puppy to the quirky, lovable dog he is today. This page is filled with snapshots spanning Cooper’s life, showcasing his bright personality, intelligence, and playful side. From his early days as a curious little pup with those signature white paws to his latest escapades, every photo tells a piece of his story.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&#128062Cooper is a natural in front of the camera—he’s always up for photos and videos, and he doesn’t mind being the star of the show. His happy, smart, and sometimes sneaky personality shines in every shot. Cooper is also a bit of a foodie, so if there’s any human food left unattended, it may just disappear when no one’s looking!</p>
        <br>
        <p>&#128062This past summer, we won an Insta360 8K camera, which has allowed us to capture even more of Cooper’s expressions and funny moments. From his goofy grin to his "innocent" look after sneaking a snack, every detail is now crystal clear in high definition. Each image is a testament to Cooper's unique spirit—whether he's napping, playing, or posing proudly, he has a way of making every photo special.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&#128062Enjoy scrolling through these snapshots of Cooper's life, and get a glimpse into the many sides of our beloved, sneaky, and endlessly entertaining dog!</p>
