          <aside></aside><p>Cooper may be a small dog, but he’s a seasoned traveler who has explored a surprising number of states! From Arizona to Texas, Michigan to Missouri, Illinois to Wisconsin, Cooper has seen it all—and he’s even been on more than six flights in his life. Despite all his travels, Cooper’s favorite destinations remain simple: he loves going to Grandma’s house and visiting any place filled with kids. He’s far more interested in human companionship than the company of other dogs, especially when children are around to dote on him.</p>
          <br>
          <p>One of our recent adventures took us to Starved Rock in Illinois, where we went on a scenic (and somewhat nerve-wracking) hike. Cooper, being a bit timid and cautious, mostly enjoyed the journey from the safety of his K9 backpack. The steep edges and heights made me nervous, so I kept him securely strapped in to avoid any daring leaps too close to the edge. Cooper has always been shy around new places, people, and animals—it usually takes him about 15 minutes to warm up and get comfortable.</p>
          <br>          
          <p>One of his most endearing routines happens at the start of every day. Cooper has a strict morning ritual: he simply refuses to get out of bed until he’s had his fill of belly rubs. It’s as if he’s saying, “I’ll start my day, but only if you make it worth my while!” Whether he’s nestled in his favorite places or exploring a new spot, Cooper’s quirky personality and love for human connection always shine through.</p>
