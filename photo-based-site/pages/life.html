      <p>Welcome to Life with Cooper, where you’ll get a glimpse into his everyday routine and see the quirks that make him so lovable and unique. A typical day with Cooper is full of routines, surprises, and plenty of laughter.</p>

      <p>Our mornings always begin with a little negotiation. We ask him to go outside, but Cooper has a non-negotiable demand: belly rubs first! Only after he’s satisfied with some belly rubs will he head outside to do his business. Once he’s back, we take a walk around the neighborhood before he comes in for breakfast. Right after he’s finished eating, he heads straight for his “treat” button and eagerly presses it, making it clear that breakfast isn't complete until he gets his treat.</p>

      <p>One of Cooper’s favorite rituals happens next: every time he comes back inside, he bolts straight to the couch, as if it’s his personal throne. This funny, unique routine never fails to make us smile. He’s also very attached to his unicorn toys, and it’s common to see him pulling them out of his toy basket for a round of play. If you’re ever missing a sock, there’s a good chance Cooper’s hidden it somewhere around the house—it’s his sneaky way of adding his own touch to the decor!</p>                                    
      <img src = "../images/gallery/pic1.JPG" alt="gallery pic1" id ="img7" onclick = 'change("../images/gallery/pic1.JPG")'>
      <p>Cooper is a big fan of puzzle toys and shows off his smarts by solving them quickly. Occasionally, he even throws them down the stairs to see if he can “crack the code” a little faster. Over the years, he’s matured from a playful puppy to a cuddle-loving companion. Every night, he insists on “Cooper time,” a special snuggle session before he settles down at my feet to sleep.</p>
