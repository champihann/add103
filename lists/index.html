<h3>5 Terms to Know About Neurodiversity:</h3>
  <dt>Neurodiversity</dt>
    <dd>- A concept that promotes the idea that neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia, are natural variations of the human brain rather than disorders that need to be cured.</dd>
  <dt>Executive Functioning</dt>
    <dd>- A set of mental skills related to planning, organizing, and completing tasks. Autistic individuals often have challenges with executive functioning, making it difficult to manage daily activities or shift focus between tasks.</dd>
  <dt>Meltdown</dt>
    <dd>- An intense response to overwhelming stimuli, typically resulting in emotional or physical outbursts. Meltdowns are not tantrums but rather a loss of control due to sensory or emotional overload.</dd>
  <dt>Hyperfocus</dt>
    <dd>- The ability to focus intensely on a specific task or interest for extended periods, often to the exclusion of other activities. While this can be a strength in certain situations, it can also make it hard for autistic individuals to shift attention to other tasks.</dd>
  <dt>Camouflaging</dt>
    <dd>- The practice of masking or hiding autistic traits to blend in socially. This often involves imitating othersâ€™ behaviors or suppressing personal habits, which can be mentally and emotionally exhausting for autistic individuals.</dd>
