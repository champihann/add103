    <p>"Along Came a Spider," the 2001 film adaptation of James Patterson’s novel, delivers a gripping psychological
        thriller with a strong performance from Morgan Freeman as Detective Alex Cross. The movie, directed by Lee Tamahori,
        follows Cross as he investigates the kidnapping of a senator’s daughter and her friend, unraveling a chilling plot
        by a cunning and manipulative villain. While the film effectively builds suspense and showcases Freeman's commanding
        presence, it occasionally veers into formulaic territory, with some plot twists feeling predictable. Nonetheless, it
        remains an engaging watch for fans of crime dramas, offering plenty of tension and intrigue</p>
