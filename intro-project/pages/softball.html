            <p>I have enjoyed getting back into softball at McHenry County College, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to play once again. This fall, I’ve had a handful of base hits and runs, making it a rewarding experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fall ball is more relaxed than it is in Spring, but I'm excited for what’s to come. I may even get the chance to pitch again in Spring, which I'm looking forward to!

            <p>During my time at Pioneer High School, I was fortunate to be recognized as an all-star player and received many awards and accomplishments. One of my favorite aspects of playing was the coaching staff. They were some of the best coaches I've had, working tirelessly to bring our team together and foster a positive environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            Among the many memorable moments, one of the silliest was when I hit a foul ball that broke someone’s driver’s side window! It was a line drive that went straight through, and everyone erupted in laughter. I guess they shouldn’t have parked there!
