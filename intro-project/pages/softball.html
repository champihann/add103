            <p><b><q>Restpect All, Fear None!</q> Go Scots!</b>
            <br>I have enjoyed getting back into softball at McHenry County College, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to play once again. I am jersey number #99 for this team. This fall, I’ve had a handful of base hits and runs, making it a rewarding experience. This past saturday October 12th we lost to the Alumni team. We aren't the most competitive team but it sure is a lot of fun.

            Fall ball is more relaxed than it is in Spring, but I'm excited for what’s to come. I may even get the chance to pitch again in Spring, which I'm looking forward to!

            <p><b>4-Year Varsity Softball Player</b>
            <br>I was fortunate enough to make the team as a freshman, although I didn’t play much that first year since the seniors held all my positions. But that year set the stage for the future, and our team claimed district and regional championships, falling just short in the quarterfinals.
            <br>
            <br>
            My sophomore year was when I truly hit my stride. With nine seniors on the team, we were strong enough to make a serious run for the state championship, but a narrow loss in districts was a tough disappointment for all of us. After that season, our coach retired, and we had to rebuild the team under a new coach. It was challenging, but it helped me grow as a player and as a person.
            <br>
            <br>    
            During my time at Pioneer, I was proud to be recognized as an all-star player, earning several awards and accomplishments. What I appreciated most was our coaching staff, who worked tirelessly to bring us together and create a positive, competitive environment. One of the most memorable and humorous moments came when I hit a foul ball that shattered someone’s driver’s side window! It was a line drive that no one saw coming, and while I felt bad, we couldn’t help but laugh—note to everyone: <b>Don’t park too close to the field!</b>

            I was jersey #8 and played multiple positions. I continued to develop my skills with Ann Arbor Gold Fastpitch, where I played summer ball from 12u through 18u. This travel team was my summer home, and it gave me invaluable experience playing against tough competition and building lasting friendships with my teammates. A big thanks to my Mom for driving me to all my travel games! We had games and tournaments nearly every single weekend.

            <br>
            My first experience playing softball outside of rec ball was at Slauson Middle School, and it was a turning point in my athletic journey. I was jersey #7. Coach Curry, one of the best coaches I’ve had, made sure we stayed focused—but if you talked back, you’d be running laps for the rest of practice. I had a strong personality back then and wasn’t shy about sharing my opinions, so I became well-acquainted with running laps! <br>
            <br>One of my proudest moments from middle school softball was pitching a no-hitter. It was a huge accomplishment for me at the time, and Coach Curry signed the game ball afterward. I still have that ball in my box of memories, and it reminds me of those early days when I really started to develop as a player.
