        <ul>
        <li>Cooper is Havanese poodle mix with a little bit of Schnauzer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This quirky 16lb dog, known as "Cooper Whiteshoes" thanks to his front white paws, is full of personality.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cooper’s day starts with mandatory belly rubs before anything else, and he’s never shy about asking for a treat—especially by pressing his beloved talking buttons.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>     
        <li>When it comes to skills, Cooper is a pro! He knows 25+ commands, from classic tricks like shake and rollover to using his talking buttons to demand treats.</li>
        <br>
        <li>He is even a star in a YouTube video "driving" his Porsche Macan to the tune of "Ridin' Dirty."</li>
        </ul> 
        <ul>
        <li>Cooper’s favorite activities include licking his favorite humans, running around the yard, and riding shotgun on road trip adventures.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Indoors, he loves lounging on the couch with his unicorn toys or barking at the mailman. He’s also a beach lover, running wild when sand gets between his paws.</li>
