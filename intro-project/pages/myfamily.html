    <h3>The Champ-i-Hann Family:</h3>
    <p>The nickname "Champ-i-Hann's" came about as a playful take on the song "We Are theChampions" by Queen. It symbolizes our family’s strong bond and the idea that we are all champions in our own way—after all, champions are number one! Growing up as theyoungest of nine siblings, with seven sisters and one brother, the house was often wild andunruly. While it was fun being part of such a large family, I’ve come to appreciate the peaceand simplicity of my quieter life now, without a full house of activity 24/7.</p>

    <h3>What's the Point Club:</h3>
        <p>The "What's the Point?" club was created many years ago by the Little Kids gang, which included me, Emily, and Cyndi. The question "What's the Point?" always had the sameanswer: "It's Family!" It was our way of reminding ourselves of the importance of family, evenwhen things got chaotic. Meanwhile, our older siblings—part of the Big Kids gang—bossed us around, claiming to be older and wiser.
Every family event emphasized this motto, reminding us that no matter what happens,family is the most important thing.</p>
