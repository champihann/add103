        <h3>The Champ-i-Hann Family:</h3>
        <p>The nickname <mark><b><q>Champ-i-Hann's</q></b></mark> came about as a playful take on the song <cite><b><q>We Are the Champions </q>by Queen</b></cite>. It symbolizes our family’s strong bond and the idea that we are all champions in our own way—after all, champions are number one! Growing up as the youngest of nine siblings, with seven sisters and one brother, the house was often wild and unruly. While it was fun being part of such a large family, I’ve come to appreciate the peace and simplicity of my quieter life now, without a full house of activity <b>24/7.</b></p>

        <h3>What's the Point Club:</h3>
        <p>The <b><q>What's the Point?</q></b> club was created many years ago by the Little Kids gang, which included me, Emily, and Cyndi. The question <i>"What's the Point?"</i> always had the same answer: <mark><strong><q>It's Family! </q></strong></mark>It was our way of reminding ourselves of the importance of family, even when things got chaotic. Meanwhile, our older siblings—part of the Big Kids gang—bossed us around, claiming to be older and wiser. Every family event emphasizes this motto, reminding us that no matter what happens, family is the most important thing.</p>
