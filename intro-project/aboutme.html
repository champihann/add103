            <p> Hello! My name is Shawnna Hann. I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as the youngest of nine siblings: Emily, Cyndi, Genny, Hannah, Laura, Chrissy, David, and Tamayra. My childhood was a little wild and filled with fun, shaped by the lively dynamics of a large family. Some of our most cherished family traditions include making delicious apple pudding and pizza casserole together. 
            <br>
            <br>
            From a young age, sports played a significant role in my life; I have been playing softball, basketball, and bowling for as long as I can remember. Among my family and friends, I often talk about my dog, Cooper, who is truly the best dog in the whole world. His funny quirks and personality bring so much joy and laughter to our lives.

        <h3>Professional/Academic Goals:</h3>
        <div class="middle-main-grid">
        
        <p>My love for technology is what initially inspired me to pursue a career in Software Application Design & Development. This semester, I'm still exploring my specific interests and career goals, but I'm confident that, after a few more classes at McHenry County College, I'll have a clearer sense of direction.
        <br>
        <br>
        My long-term aspiration is to develop the technical skills needed to work as a QA specialist. Throughout my career, I’ve gained valuable experience in various professional environments, and now I’m eager to focus on a specific area within software development. I am committed to growing and learning every day, and I hope to connect with fellow students and professionals through MCC’s program. If you'd like to connect professionally, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!

        <h3>Personality/Strengths:</h3>
        <div class="bottom-main-grid">
        <img src="./images/aboutme-me.JPG" alt="woman wearing unicorn hat">    
        <p>I would describe my personality as ISTP (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving), based on the Myers-Briggs personality test. I'm not the biggest fan of talking about myself, but if you get to know me, you'll find I have a dry, deadpan sense of humor.
        <br>
        <br>One of my greatest strengths is my visual-spatial intelligence, which comes in handy both in my studies and my hobbies. I’m also pretty good at sports, something that has been a big part of my life. At the end of the day, I embrace who I am—unique and true to myself. I am who I am, and no one can change that, not even me.</p>
