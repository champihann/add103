        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <div class="top-main">
            <div class="top-left">
            <p>I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as the youngest of nine siblings: Emily, Cyndi, Genny,Hannah, Laura, Chrissy, David, and Tamayra. My childhood was a little wild and fi lled withfun, shaped by the lively dynamics of a large family. Some of our most cherished familytraditions include making delicious apple pudding and pizza casserole together.

                <div class="top-right">
                <p>From a young age, sports played a signifi cant role in my life; I have been playing softball,basketball, and bowling for as long as I can remember. Among my family and friends, I oftentalk about my dog, Cooper, who is truly the best dog in the whole world. His funny quirks andpersonality bring so much joy and laughter to our lives.

        <h3>Professional/Academic Goals</h3>
        <p>My love for computers is what initially inspired me to pursue a career in technology. Thissemester, I'm still exploring my specifi c interests and career goals, but I'm confi dent that,after a few more classes at McHenry County College, I'll have a clearer sense of direction.
        </p>
        <p>My long-term aspiration is to develop the technical skills needed to work as a QA specialist.Throughout my career, I’ve gained valuable experience in various professional environments,and now I’m eager to focus on a specifi c area within software development. I am committedto growing and learning every day, and I hope to connect with fellow students andprofessionals through MCC’s program. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out to me onLinkedIn!

        <h3>Personality and Strengths</h3>
        <p>I would describe my personality as ISTP (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving), basedon the Myers-Briggs personality test. I'm not the biggest fan of talking about myself, but ifyou get to know me, you'll fi nd I have a dry, deadpan sense of humor.
        </p>
        <p>One of my greatest strengths is my visual-spatial intelligence, which comes in handy both inmy studies and my hobbies. I’m also pretty good at sports, something that has been a bigpart of my life. At the end of the day, I embrace who I am—unique and unapologetic. I amwho I am, and no one can change that, not even me.</p>
